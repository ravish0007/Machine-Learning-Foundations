# Combine Cycle Power Plant

A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict the electrical energy.
